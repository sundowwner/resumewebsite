                <h1 class="summary animated fadeInRight">About</h1><br>
                <p class="summaryP animated fadeInRight">I am relatively new to the Bay Area having moved out from Denver, Colorado this past spring 2015 where I spent the past 20 years.  I am eager to explore new opportunities in the region. I am an achievement-oriented professional with 15+ years experience in IT leadership. I have a proven track record of managing complex projects and implementing effective process improvements. </p>
                <p class="summaryP animated fadeInRight">
                    In my most recent position as Lead Technical Analyst with CenturyLink, I supervised implementation of new technology projects and provided IT expertise in all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). My role included serving as project manager supervising scope development, requirements analysis, project design, QA testing, manpower scheduling, and budgeting. While in this position, I ensured that the migration of technologies regarding the merger between Qwest Communications International and CenturyLink were successfully achieved. I was also responsible for yielding a $10M annual cost savings through development of a new invoice auditing system.
                </p>
                <p class="summaryP animated fadeInRight">
                    I am passionate about what I do and truly enjoy coming to work each day. I am currently seeking a challenging position within a highly-reputable company where I can make a significant positive impact.
